## Data Analysis on Leveraged S&P 500 ETF's
### Case Study:S&P 500 Leveraged ETFs

Investing in leveraged ETFs over extended periods sparks debates, with concerns about daily rebalancing causing losses in the short term. Yet, a market's long-term positive bias offsets this, favoring upward trends. Similarly, while lump-sum investments in leveraged ETFs during market declines may lead to slow recovery, dollar-cost averaging, where you invest a fixed amount at intervals, mitigates risks. This analysis reveals that 2x and 3x leveraged S&P 500 ETFs outperform non-leveraged ones, but they also come with higher volatility. Leveraged ETFs did not exist at the creation of the S&P 500. Hence due to the absence of historical data on leveraged ETFs. In this analysis, the leveraged ETFs price are obtained via median leverage from SSO and UPRO, which are 2x S&P 500 and 3x S&P 500 leveraged ETFs respectively. SSO started trading in 2006 and UPRO started trading in 2009.Although not exact, it provides a close estimate. The analysis concludes that 3x ETFs offer the highest returns and volatility, 2x ETFs strike a balance, and 1x ETFs ensure lower volatility with albeit, the lowest return.

### Neural Network: S&P 500 Leveraged ETFs Prices

In the absence of historical data for 2x SSO and 3x UPRO ETFs before 2006 and 2009 respectively, a neural network approximates daily leverage based on known S&P 500 daily percentage changes. Each neural network for SSO and UPRO employs an input layer, two hidden layers, and one output layer. Though code is generalized for multiple neurons per hidden layer. Median squared error validates the neural network with a pseudo early stopping approach, optimizing weight matrices for precise leverage price prediction. The code effectively reproduces SSO 2x ETF prices and closely approximates UPRO 3x ETF prices until around 2020. An insight into the neural network's limitations arises from UPRO's trading data starting later than SSO's, influencing price prediction accuracy. Enhancing the neural network's performance for UPRO entails accumulating more trading days' data for better predictions. Plots comparing predicted and median leveraged ETF prices highlight these dynamics.

### MNIST Classification Neural Network From Scratch

This notebook demonstrates the creation of a feedforward classification neural network from scratch using R, without relying on machine learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. The network is designed for MNIST data classification and includes an input layer, one hidden layer as an option or two hidden layers as an option, and an output layer. Two types of neural networks are explored: one without mappings and another employing Fourier feature mapping, inspired by the paper  *“Fourier Features Let Networks Learn High Frequency Functions in Low Dimensional Domains”* . Due to the detailed nature of the derivation, only key mathematical components are included for clarity. The network achieves a minimum categorical cross-entropy (CCE) loss of 0.16 on testing data and optimal testing accuracy of 95.38%. Familiarity with matrix algebra and multivariable calculus is recommended for understanding the methodology.
